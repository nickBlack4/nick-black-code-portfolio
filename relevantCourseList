Relevant classes I have taken that I couldn't find the course listing for from my Universitiy before transferring to C of C:

Intro to Higher Math - proof based, logic, sets, relations, ...

Intro to web programming - PHP and SQL based
Intro to programming - Python based

Through this coursework I garnered experience in C, C++, Java, Python, PHP, and an assembly language that was written with for a 16-bit cpu to limit the instruction set and make the coursework manageable for a semester.  i.e. it wasn't a 32 or 64-bit ISA that would be beyond the scope of a semester course for our level of experience.
