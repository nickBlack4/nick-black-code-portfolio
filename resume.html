                        <h2>Software Engineer - Leidos - May 2019 to Present</h2>

                        <br /><br />

                        I started my work at Leidos working on an app called Pathways. Pathways helped keep track of patients and their journey through the hospital.
                        <br /><br />
                        Pathways was built utilizing Polymer, HTML, and CSS on the front end. The unit testing was done with Sinon, Mocha, and Chai. The backend was LEAF (a proprietary framework)/Java, and utilized Docker for container management, MongoDB for the database, and Kafka/Zookeeper for its messaging system. Build automation was handled by Jenkins.
                        <br /><br />
                        As of now, I am working on a new application under the careC2 umbrella. We have borrowed some microservices from Pathways extending them as well as creating new ones. The tooling has changed with the addition of Kubernetes for clusters in conjunction with Docker. We have also replaced Polymer with React.
