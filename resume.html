              <h2>Software Engineer - Leidos - May 2019 to Present</h2>

              <p>
                I started my work at Leidos working on an app called Pathways.
                Pathways helped keep track of patients and their journey through
                the hospital.
                <br /><br />

                Pathways was built utilizing Polymer, HTML, and CSS on the front
                end. The unit testing was done with Sinon, Mocha, and Chai. The
                backend was LEAF (a proprietary framework)/Java, and utilized
                Docker for container management, MongoDB for the database, and
                Kafka/Zookeeper for its messaging system. Build automation was
                handled by Jenkins.
                <br /><br />
                As of now, I am working on a new application under the careC2
                umbrella. We have borrowed some microservices from Pathways
                extending them as well as creating new ones. The tooling has
                changed with the addition of Kubernetes for clusters in
                conjunction with Docker. We have also replaced Polymer with
                React.

              <h2>Web Developer - Quaver Music - Oct 2018 to May 2019</h2>

              <p>
                Design and deploy web applications utilizing the Dart (Google)
                programming language, write frameworks to ease the development
                of future code, and refactor existing code within the code base
                to meet current standards.
                <br /><br />
                My time at Quaver was spent writing Dart and Stage XL code to
                complete micro games. I would take assets given to me in
                Illustrator by the art team and create small games utilizing
                gaffs, sprites, sound files, etc. These would be deployed into
                our dev environment and once we tested them fully, they were
                moved to alpha and then eventually production where they were
                embedded into the live site and curriculum.
